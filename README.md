# Lexical-Syntactic-Analysis
This project consists of two components:
1. **PHP Parser (`parser.php`)** – Checks the **lexical and syntactic correctness** of input code and converts it into an **XML representation**.
2. **Python Interpreter (`interpret.py`)** – Reads the generated **XML program** and executes its instructions.
